# 📏 Posture Detection Bot

A Python-based real-time posture detection tool that uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to analyze body alignment through your webcam. It provides instant visual feedback on whether you are sitting or standing upright to help you maintain good posture and avoid discomfort or long-term health issues.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time posture analysis**: Detects your posture instantly using webcam feed.
- **Visual feedback**: Displays posture status directly on the video:
  - 🟢 **Green**: You are upright.
  - 🔴 **Red**: You are slouching.
- Lightweight and easy to set up.

## 📋 How It Works
1. **Pose Estimation**: The tool leverages the **MediaPipe Pose** model to track key body landmarks such as shoulders and hips.
2. **Posture Evaluation**: It calculates the vertical alignment of the shoulders and hips to determine if the user is upright.
3. **Feedback**: Based on the analysis:
   - If the shoulders and hips are vertically aligned (within a certain threshold), it marks the posture as **upright**.
   - Otherwise, it marks the posture as **slouching**.
